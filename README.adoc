= Moditect SnakeYAML Showcase

This github project aims to show how to create a jlink `.zip` bundle
containing a `org.yaml:snakeyaml` dependency.

Three plugins are being actively used for this:

* https://github.com/moditect/moditect[moditect-maven-plugin] to add a module descriptor (`module-info.class`) to the snakeyaml dependency.
* maven-compiler-plugin to pick up the new dependency.
* Finally, the brand new https://github.com/apache/maven-jlink-plugin[maven-jlink-plugin] to create the jlink archive.

== Explanation ofâ€¦

=== â€¦ the moditect plugin

The moditect documentation is a littleâ€¦ sparse.

In the case you do have an existing dependency (like snakeyaml) which does
not have a module-descriptor, you want to execute the `add-module-info` target.
This will create a modified `.jar` archive containing a `module-info.class` file.

You also want this to be generated in the `generate-resources` phase.
The udertow showcase uses this goal in the `package` phase for other purposes.

=== â€¦ the compiler plugin

By appending the argument `--module-path=$target/modules`,
the compiler plugin will pick up the modified snakeyaml jar file
and use it instead of the original one.

=== â€¦ the jlink plugin

I am using a custom jlink plugin with two additional PRs already merged:

* https://github.com/apache/maven-jlink-plugin/pull/21[Classifier-PR] to have both a jar artifact and a zip artifact.
* https://github.com/apache/maven-jlink-plugin/pull/14[--add-options-PR] to be able to add custom java runtime arguments.

Besides the `-Xmx` argument, I added a launcher with the name `start`.
It shows the syntax.

== Try it out

The main will read a file `test.yaml` and output itâ€™s using a `.foreach()` statement.

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean verify -Pjlink
[â€¦]
$ ./target/maven-jlink/bin/start
id: [abc].
name: [ðŸ˜„ Î“ÎµÎ¹Î± ÏƒÎ±Ï‚].

You can also extract the archive `target/snakeyaml-moditect-showcase-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip`.
It contains the same binary (`bin/start`).
